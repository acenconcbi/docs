If you are a fan of Battlefield 1 and want to listen to its sound files outside of the game, you might be wondering how to extract them from the game files. Unfortunately, there is no official way to do this, as the game's sound files are encrypted and compressed in a proprietary format. However, there are some unofficial tools and methods that can help you access and enjoy the sound files from Battlefield 1. In this article, we will show you how to do this step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Frosty Tool Suite
 
Frosty Tool Suite is a collection of tools that can mod and edit games that use the Frostbite engine, such as Battlefield 1. One of these tools is Frosty Editor, which can open and browse the game's data files, including the sound files. You can download Frosty Tool Suite from [here](https://frostytoolsuite.com/downloads.html). Make sure you download the latest version that supports Battlefield 1.
 
After downloading Frosty Tool Suite, extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, run FrostyEditor.exe as administrator. You will see a window asking you to select a game executable. Browse to your Battlefield 1 installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Battlefield 1) and select bf1.exe. Click Select and wait for Frosty Editor to load the game's data.
 
## Step 2: Locate and Export the Sound Files
 
Once Frosty Editor has loaded the game's data, you will see a tree view of the game's data on the left side of the window. Expand the Audio folder and then expand the SoundBanks folder. You will see several subfolders with names like Common, English(US), SP\_Missions, etc. These subfolders contain different categories of sound files for different languages and game modes.
 
To export a sound file, right-click on it and select Export. You will be asked to choose a destination folder for the exported file. Note that the exported file will have a .sbao extension, which is not a common audio format. You will need another tool to convert it to a playable format.
 
## Step 3: Convert and Play the Sound Files
 
To convert the .sbao files to a playable format, you will need a tool called ww2ogg. You can download ww2ogg from [here](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg/releases). Extract ww2ogg to a folder of your choice. Then, open a command prompt window and navigate to that folder using the cd command.
 
To convert a .sbao file to an .ogg file, use the following command:
 `ww2ogg.exe input_file.sbao --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin` 
Replace input\_file.sbao with the name of the .sbao file you want to convert. You will also need to download a file called packed\_codebooks\_aoTuV\_603.bin from [here](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg/raw/master/packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin) and place it in the same folder as ww2ogg.exe. This file contains some data that ww2ogg needs to decode the .sbao files.
 
After running the command, you should see an output file with an .ogg extension in the same folder as ww2ogg.exe. You can play this file with any media player that supports .ogg files, such as VLC or Foobar2000.
