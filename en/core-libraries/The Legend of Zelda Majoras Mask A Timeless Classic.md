The game is notable for its innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the use of masks that can transform Link into different forms with unique abilities, and the recurring three-day cycle that affects various aspects of the game world. The game also features a darker and more mature tone than previous Zelda games, dealing with themes such as death, grief, identity, and fate. The game has been praised by critics and fans alike for its story, graphics, music, and level design, and is widely considered one of the best video games ever made.
 
The game was re-released as part of The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition for the GameCube in 2003, for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2009, for the Wii U's Virtual Console service in 2016, and for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022. The game also received an enhanced remake for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015, titled The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D, which featured improved graphics, controls, and gameplay tweaks.
 
If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda series or action-adventure games in general, you owe it to yourself to play this timeless classic. You will not regret it.

The gameplay of Majora's Mask is similar to that of Ocarina of Time, but with some notable differences. The game is divided into four regions, each with its own temple dungeon that must be cleared to advance the plot. Link can explore the regions on foot, on horseback, or by using various forms of transportation, such as boats, cannons, and deku flowers. Link can also use his Ocarina to play songs that have various effects, such as warping to different locations, slowing down or speeding up time, and summoning allies.
 
One of the most distinctive features of the game is the three-day cycle that repeats itself until Link succeeds in his quest. The game world changes depending on the time of day and the day of the cycle, with different events, characters, and activities occurring at different times. Link can use his Ocarina to reset the cycle at any time, but he will lose most of his items and progress in the process. However, some items and events are permanent and will carry over to the next cycle, such as masks, songs, and key items.
 
Another unique feature of the game is the use of masks that can transform Link into different forms. There are 24 masks in total, each with its own function and purpose. Some masks are required to progress through the game, while others are optional and provide various benefits or challenges. The most important masks are the ones that allow Link to transform into a Deku Scrub, a Goron, a Zora, or a Fierce Deity. Each form has its own abilities and weaknesses, such as swimming underwater, rolling at high speeds, flying with propellers, or shooting beams from a sword.
 
The game also features several side quests and mini-games that can reward Link with items, rupees, heart pieces, or masks. Some of these side quests involve helping various characters with their problems or fulfilling their requests within a certain time limit. The game also has a notebook system that keeps track of Link's interactions with the characters and their schedules. Completing all the side quests and mini-games is necessary to obtain all the masks and achieve 100% completion.
