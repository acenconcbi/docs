## How to Play Sonic Unleashed for Android
 
Once you have downloaded and installed Sonic Unleashed for Android, you can start playing the game and enjoy its dual gameplay. Here are some tips and tricks to help you master the game and have more fun.

- The game is divided into seven continents, each with its own hub world, action stages, and boss battles. You can access different continents from the world map, but some of them will be locked until you progress in the story.
- The game also switches between day and night cycles, which affect the gameplay and the environment. During the day, you play as Sonic the Hedgehog, who can run at high speeds, perform homing attacks, drift, slide, and boost. During the night, you play as Sonic the Werehog, who can stretch his arms, grab enemies, unleash combos, climb walls, and swing on poles.
- To complete each action stage, you need to reach the goal ring at the end. Along the way, you can collect rings, medals, lives, and other items. Rings are your health and currency. Medals are used to unlock new stages and abilities. Lives are extra chances to continue if you lose all your rings or fall into a pit.
- You can also earn points by defeating enemies, collecting rings, and performing stunts. Points are used to increase your rank at the end of each stage. The higher your rank, the more rewards you get.
- Some stages have hidden secrets and shortcuts that you can find by exploring or using your abilities. For example, you can use Sonic's speed to break through walls or jump over gaps. You can also use Sonic's Werehog form to smash crates or pull levers.
- Some stages also have special challenges that you can complete for extra points or medals. For example, you can try to finish a stage within a time limit, without taking damage, or without using any abilities.
- To face each boss battle, you need to restore the Gaia Temple of each continent by collecting Chaos Emeralds and Gaia Keys. The boss battles are different depending on whether it's day or night. During the day, you need to chase and attack the boss while avoiding its attacks. During the night, you need to dodge and counter the boss's moves while finding its weak spots.
- You can upgrade Sonic's abilities by spending experience points that you earn from completing stages and boss battles. You can choose to upgrade Sonic's speed, strength, life, shield, or unleash gauge. The unleash gauge is a special meter that fills up as you collect rings or deal damage. When it's full, you can activate it to boost your abilities temporarily.
- You can also customize Sonic's appearance by buying or finding different shoes, gloves, sunglasses, or accessories. You can equip them from the status menu or from Professor Pickle's lab.
